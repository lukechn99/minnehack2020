# Study Buddy: Excel Together (minnehack2020)
__IDEA DESCRIPTION__  
A platform for University of Minnesota students to coordinate study efforts with peers that share courses.  
Students will be able to create a login and find their classes from a list of all classes at the U to include in their profile. Students can submit requests to study for a particular course on SBET and be matched with another student who wants to study for the same course. Potentially, they can include details like what they want to focus on (homework, midterm), location, time, and contact. This platform can be expanded in the future to help coordinate students who want to sell and buy textbooks, and opportunities with professors (research, mentoring).
